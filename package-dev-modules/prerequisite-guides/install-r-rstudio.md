# Install R and RStudio

You will need:
- R 4.x. Version 3.6.x will likely be fine but we recommend that you 
install the latest versions if possible
- RStudio 1.2 or above




## Installing R

Download the pre-compiled binary for your OS from https://cloud.r-project.org/ 
and install. More specifically, for version number #.#.# (e.g. 4.0.0):

### For Windows

Click "Download R for Windows", then "base", then "Download R #.#.# for 
Windows". This will download an `.exe` file; once downloaded, open to start the 
installation. If you do not have administrator rights, the installer will 
default to install in your Documents folder - if you prefer, you can change the 
location to another folder that you have write access to.

### For Mac

Click "Download R for (Mac) OS X", then "R-#.#.#.pkg" to download the installer.
Run the installer to complete installation.

### For Linux

Click "Download R for Linux". Instructions on installing are given for Debian,
Redhat, Suse and Ubuntu distributions. Where there is a choice, install both 
`r-base` and `r-base-dev`.

## Installing R Studio

Downloads are available from https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ (scroll to the end of the page to see the downloads). You want RStudio Desktop (Open Source License).

### For Windows with no admin rights

Download the `.zip` source archive under "Zip/Tarballs". Extract the files to a 
folder where you have write access, e.g. `C:\Users\username\RStudio`. In this 
folder, open the `bin` directory and find the RStudio program: it is named 
`rstudio.exe`, but the file extension will typically be hidden, so look for 
`rstudio`. Right-click this executable to create a desktop shortcut. 
Double-click the executable or use the shortcut to open.

### For all other operating systems

Download the relevant installer for your OS listed under "Installers for 
Supported Platforms". Run the installer to complete installation.
